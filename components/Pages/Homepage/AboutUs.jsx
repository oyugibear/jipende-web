            <b>Our History</b>

            Africa Jipende Wellness Limited was founded in November 2018 by Rubie Miseda with the goal of promoting holistic mental health and wellness in Kenya and Africa as a whole. The founder identified that she and many around her didnâ€™t have the appropriate support for their mental well-being.
