            <p>
                Africa Jipende Wellness Limited was founded in November 2018 by Rubie Miseda with the goal of promoting holistic 
                mental health and wellness in Kenya and Africa as a whole. The founder identified that she and many around her didn&apos;t 
                have the appropriate support for their mental well-being.
